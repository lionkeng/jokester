This is a bare minimum example demonstrating the use of langchainJS, openAI LLM, and Typescript.

## getting started

copy the file `.env.example` to `.env`

for development:

```
pnpm dev
```

for production:

```
pnpm build-swc
pnpm start
```

## tooling

- pnpm
- typescript
- tsx
- tsc
- swc

For development, we use _tsx_. For production, you can either use _tsc_ or _swc_ to build.

## configuration files

```
tsconfig.json
.swrc
```
